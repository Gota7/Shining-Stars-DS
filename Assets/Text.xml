stick out your tongue 
and swallow an enemy. 

Press [\r]FE05030001 again to 
spit it out.
Or, you can lay an egg
by crouching while your 
mouth is still full.
Press [\r]FE05030001 again 
to throw the egg. 



Remember, some enemies 
won't turn into eggs 
even if you swallow 
them.</Text>

  <Text index="68" id="0044">Welcome to Shine City!
This place was rebuilt
not too long ago by
the caring Princess I
don't remember her
name. I think it was a
name of a fruit or
something and
with the help of the
beautiful protector of
the cosmos, Rosalina.
They dedicated this
place to the Grand
Shining Star, but
Bowser came here
and opened the portals
to the Shining Stars. His
goal is to collect them
and flood the entire
kingdom with lava. He
plans to use the power
of the Shining Stars
because they have the
odd tendency to suck
in nearby lava. He has
gathered some of the
stars in his various
towers and  fortresses.
You have to collect all
stars to revive the
Grand Shining Star.
Good luck!

Hold [\r]FE05030002 as Yoshi: 
Flutter kick
[\r]FE05030006: Crouch


[\r]FE05030001: Swallow items, 
pick up items, or punch
depending on which 
character you are.

Piece of cake, right?</Text>
  <Text index="94" id="005E">You have to master two
important jumping 
techniques if you want 
to succeed.

To triple jump, run and
then jump three times 
in a row. If you time it
right, you'll hop, skip, 
then jump really high.
Next, go for distance
with the long jump. Run,
crouch, and then jump 
to leap far.

Got that? Triple jump,
long jump.

chance without them.</Text>

Now I'm really, really,
REALLY mad!
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!</Text>
  <Text index="200" id="00C8">Hey! Knock it off! 
That's the second time
you've nailed me. 

Now you're really 
asking for it, 
linguine breath!</Text>
  <Text index="201" id="00C9">Owwch! Uncle! Uncle!
Okay, I give up! 
Take this Star!
Whew! 
I feel better now.
I don't really need it
anymore, anyway--
I can see the stars 
through my ceiling at 
night. 
They make me feel...
peaceful. 
Please, come back and 
visit anytime.</Text>
  <Text index="202" id="00CA"></Text>
  <Text index="203" id="00CB"></Text>
  <Text index="204" id="00CC">Tough luck! 
Looks like Princess 
Toadstool isn't here...
Gwa ha ha!! 
Go ahead--just try to
grab me by the tail! 
You'll never be able 
to swing ME around! 
A wimp like you could 
never throw me out by
circling the Touch
Screen. Never!
Gwa ha ha!!</Text>
  <Text index="205" id="00CD">Grrr! I was a bit 
careless. 
This is not what I had
planned...
But I still hold the 
power of the Stars...
AND I still have Peach.
Gwa ha ha! 
You'll get no more 
Stars from me! I'm not
done with you yet, but
I'll let you go for now.
You'll pay for this...
later!
Gwa ha ha!</Text>
  <Text index="206" id="00CE">Pestering me again, are
you? Can't you see 
that I'm having a merry
old time, making mischief
with my minions?
Now, return the Stars!
I stole them first, and
my troops in the walls
need them! 
Gwa ha ha!</Text>
  <Text index="207" id="00CF">Ooowaah! Can it be 
that I've lost?! The 
power of the Stars 
has failed me...this time.
Consider this a draw.
Next time, I'll be in
perfect condition.

Now, if you want to 
see your precious 
princess, come to the 
top of the tower.
I'll be waiting!
Gwa ha ha ha!</Text>
  <Text index="208" id="00D0">That's just fine--I've
been looking for 
something to fry with 
my fire breath!
Your Star Power is 
useless against me! 
Your friends are all 
trapped in the walls...
And you'll never see 
the princess again!
Gwa ha ha ha!</Text>
  <Text index="209" id="00D1">Nooo! It can't be!
You've really beaten 
me, Mario?!! I gave 
those troops power, but
now it's fading away!
Arrgghh! I can see 
peace returning to the
world! I can't stand it!
But it's not over yet...

C'mon, troops! Let's 
watch the ending 
together!
Gwa ha ha!</Text>
  <Text index="210" id="00D2">Noooo! You've really 
beaten me this time, 
Mario! I can't stand 
always losing to you!

My troops...worthless!
They've turned over 
all the Power Stars! 


Wait, say that again. 
There are 150 Stars 
in all??? What?! There
were some in the castle
that I missed??!!
Now I see peace
returning to the world...
I really hate that! 
It's so horrible I can't
watch. I'm outta here!
Just you wait until 
next time. Until then, 
keep that Touch Screen
smokin'!
Gwa ha haaaaaaa!</Text>
  <Text index="211" id="00D3">You're Mario!!!
What are you doing 
here?! My underlings locked
you up in that room.
Never mind.
I'll deal with you myself!
Now I will trample you 
as you have trampled us!</Text>
  <Text index="212" id="00D4">Whaaa?! You're...
Ma-Mari...
...
Huh?
Oooh, you're just that 
Luigi fellow. I confused 
you with Mario. Your 
mustaches look so similar.
Pshaw! I'll deal with you 
specially.
Now, bring it on!</Text>
  <Text index="213" id="00D5">I have my sights set on
Mario. You're hardly even
worth the energy it would
take to trample you.
But I do so love to 
stomp on those who 
have spent all eternity 
stomping my clan.
And since you've come
all this way...
Bring it on!</Text>
  <Text index="214" id="00D6">Bwa ha ha!
I'm no ordinary Goomba...
I am Goomboss, the 
great Goomba, the grand
pooh-bah Goomba.
That Mario always stomps
on us. But now the 
tables have turned!
I locked him up in a
room.
I bet he's crying like 
a baby.
I have no business with 
you, so scram! 

There's no way a 
prehistoric wimp like you
could beat my stupendous
stomps!</Text>
  <Text index="215" id="00D7">Aaaaauuuuuuurrghhh!
I am so angry I am 
cooking in my own 
succulent juices!
The Goombas have lost...
Again?!
Is this our destiny?! To
be trampled by 
oppressive feet for all 
eternity?
No, we will definitely 
triumph next time! Yes, 
next time! The Goombas'
fate is not defeat,
but perseverance! </Text>
  <Text index="216" id="00D8">This is unbelievable.
I...lost to that 
pip-squeak Luigi!
This must be some kind
of mistake! 
I'll keep my guard
up next time we battle.
Just you wait...</Text>
  <Text index="217" id="00D9">I can't believe you just
beat me like that... 
N-not too shabby. I 
figured you were a fighter
with that mean mustache.
I'll battle you again when
I have free time.
You should thank your 
lucky stars that I've got
such a packed schedule.</Text>
  <Text index="218" id="00DA">Beaten by a pip-squeak 
like you...
How did that happen?

Is it just the Goombas' 
fate to lose? 
I have Mario locked up 
in a room, you know. 
This key will open the 
door to his room! 
I still can't believe you
beat me.</Text>
  <Text index="219" id="00DB">Eee hee hee!
I am Big Boo, the spookiest
of all the spirits!
I locked up the wimpy 
green mustache man. And 
I'll do the same to you!
Eee hee hee!
Since I'm a ghost, I can 
turn invisible in the 
mirror's reflection. You'll 
have to attack me from 
behind to defeat me. 
But you'll die of fright
before that ever 
happens! And then you'll
be one of us!</Text>
  <Text index="220" id="00DC">Eee hee hee!
I am Big Boo, the 
ghastliest of all ghosts!
What the...? I thought I 
locked you up...
Well, never mind.
Now I'll really creep you
out! You can't escape...
Eee hee hee!</Text>
  <Text index="221" id="00DD">Eee hee hee!
I am Big Boo, the scariest
of the spirits.
Eek! What's this?! Your 
face... It would even 
scare a ghost. 
How horrible!
You've got it backwards...

I do the scaring around 
here!

All right, now I'll put 
some real fear in that 
frightening face of yours!
Eee hee hee!</Text>
  <Text index="222" id="00DE"></Text>
  <Text index="223" id="00DF">Eee hee hee!
You can never really kill 
a ghost! We always come 
back! See you again.
Eee hee hee!</Text>
  <Text index="224" id="00E0">Eee hee hee!
We ghosts always rise 
from the dead.

I just love the look of 
terror on your face!
In fact, I live for it!
Eee hee hee!
See you soon!</Text>
  <Text index="225" id="00E1">Augh! The scariest one 
wins, and your face is 
flesh-creepingly 
frightening.
Good thing I don't have 
any flesh! Eee hee hee!
This is not the end.
See you again.</Text>
  <Text index="226" id="00E2"></Text>
  <Text index="227" id="00E3">You there with a mustache!
I am the king of cold, 
Chief Chilly. I lock up 
anyone who challenges 
the greatness of my 
mustache. 
I am the mustache master!
In fact, I locked up a
rude fellow just the 
other day. 


Hmph!! The nerve of him,
coming to my realm looking
like that.
Your mustache is not 
altogether bad. Not as 
grand as mine, of course. 
But what insolence in 
trying to show me up!
I shall shave that fuzz
right off your face.
Here I come!</Text>
  <Text index="228" id="00E4">You there with a mustache!
I am the king of cold,

I lock up anyone who 
challenges the superiority
of my 'stache. 
In fact, I locked up one 
such fellow just the
other day.
Hmm. What a sad, mangy 
mustache you've got there.

It hardly seems worth it 
to destroy you. With a 
'stache like that, you're 
clearly the sidekick, not 
the star. 

But I'm between meetings 
now, so I might as well.
In the battle for the best

Ha ha ha! 
Bring it on, peach fuzz!</Text>

What's this? You look just
like the impertinent 
mustached man I locked up
the other day.
Has everyone been taking 
mustache grower?
There's only one way to 
settle this once and for 
all. 

We'll battle man-to-man 
to see who has the best 
mustache!
Let's rumble!</Text>
  <Text index="230" id="00E6">Hmm? I see you have no

It's not a fair fight for
you, but luckily, I'm not a
fair fighter. Let's go!</Text>
  <Text index="231" id="00E7">Dang!!
There's someone with a 
greater mustache than 
mine? Ridiculous!
Does this mean you're 
cooler than me, too?
You might be gifted 
follically, but you better
watch out once I get my
mustache styled.</Text>
  <Text index="232" id="00E8">No way!
I lost to such a scrawny
guy like that...?
Hmmmm, did I not groom 
my mustache well enough?

I must hurry home and

Farewell!</Text>

You'll never sneak behind
me!</Text>
  <Text index="236" id="00EC">Mario! Am I glad to see
you! I hadn't seen you 
in so long that I was 
getting worried!

Looks like you met up 
with Yoshi all right, 
huh?
You better get back to 
finding the Power Stars.
Princess Toadstool is 
depending on you! 
You are our only hope.</Text>
  <Text index="237" id="00ED">Huh...? Who are you?
Oh, yes... Luigi, right?
You're always in Mario's 
shadow, so I didn't  
recognize you at first. 

Princess Toadstool is 
still trapped in the walls.
Won't you please retrieve
the Power Stars, Luigi?
But don't get in Mario's
way or anything.</Text>
  <Text index="238" id="00EE">Eek! Oh, i-it's you, Wario.
You're looking as bad as
ever. 
S-sorry. Sorry!

Don't give me that dirty
look.
A-actually, now that I 
look closer, you look 
horrible. 
Erm, horribly healthy, 
that is. I'm not just 
saying that. Have you
been working out?

Princess Toadstool is 
still trapped in the walls.
We're all counting on your
muscle to defeat Bowser
and get the Power Stars.
Wait a minute.
You wouldn't sneak one 
out of the castle, right?
Eek!
J-just kidding!</Text>
  <Text index="239" id="00EF">Thank heavens you 
came too, Yoshi! 
Bowser has locked 
Princess Toadstool and
all of us inside the 
walls. 
He stole our Power 
Stars and is using their
magic to create an evil
land of monsters in 
the castle walls and 
paintings.
Mario and his buddies 
went to retrieve the 
Stars, but they 
haven't come back. 


Last I saw them, they 
were heading to the 
room on the left with 
the painting of the 
Bob-ombs.

Where are they?! Are 
they taking a nap 
somewhere? 
So now it's up to you,
Yoshi, to find them and
retrieve the Stars! 
We all are depending 
on you!</Text>
  <Text index="240" id="00F0">Being imprisoned in these
walls can drive a 
fungus crazy. When I 
really start to freak 
out, I think to myself,
”Well, I'm going to be 
here for a while, so I
might as well stare at
the fish. They are 
oddly hypnotic.”
Then I actually start
to like being captured...
...
...
...
Aaauugh! IT'S MADNESS!
I've got to snap out of
this! You have to free
us before we're all 
completely brainwashed!
...
But for now, why don't
you gaze at the fish 
with me. You look tense.
Come relax.</Text>
  <Text index="241" id="00F1">Sometimes when I'm 
staring at the fish, I 
think I wouldn't mind 
staying here forever.
It helps me forget 
about my horrible fate.
Would you like to join
me and watch 
them together?
It'll soothe you.</Text>
  <Text index="242" id="00F2">Wario?! Eek!
There are no valuables
in here, so please 
don't hurt me.
I'm serious!
Why don't you just sit
down and stare at the
fish with me?</Text>
  <Text index="243" id="00F3">The Star you chose at
the beginning of the 
course appears on the 
map below.
The name of the Star
is also a clue. 


You can also collect 
Stars that don't 
appear on the map. 

Get the Stars in any
order you like.
Keep in mind, though... 

Some Stars only 
appear when you choose
specific missions, 
enemies, and items. 
Once you've retrieved 
some Stars, move on 
to the door to the 
next course. 
Everyone's waiting for
you to save us!</Text>
  <Text index="244" id="00F4">Mario, why don't you 
triple jump into the 
painting? It's such a 
stylish move! 
I'll watch it from here.</Text>
  <Text index="245" id="00F5">What?! You're Luigi? The
world's most inept and 
least charismatic 
brother? Wow! Can you 
introduce me to Mario? 
Huh? Did we meet the 
other day? I totally 
forgot. You're not 
very memorable. 

I guess your brother got
all the charisma in the 
family, huh!</Text>
  <Text index="246" id="00F6">Your reputation's bad, 
Wario, but it's only 
because your mustache
is mean looking.
If you ask me, it's a 
good look. It'll scare the
enemies into forking over
the stolen Power Stars!</Text>
  <Text index="247" id="00F7">Bowser took all the 
Stars I tried to hide 
here. There are 7 
Stars in each course.

You'll need your buddies
to get some of them. 
Teamwork goes a long 
way when you're going
up against Bowser.</Text>
  <Text index="248" id="00F8">Wow! You've already 
recovered that many 
Stars? Way to go! 

You'll have us out
of here in no time!
Be careful, though.

Bowser and his band
wrote the book on bad.
Take my advice: 

When you fall from
a high place, it'll hurt
less if you ground-pound
near the ground.
If you go back to your
room, you can switch 
places with Yoshi. 

Everyone deserves
a chance to shine.</Text>
  <Text index="249" id="00F9">Wow! You've recovered 
that many Stars? Way 
to go, Mario!
...
What? You're Luigi?
I don't believe it.
Luigi couldn't have 
pulled off such an 
impressive feat!
Stop trying to fool me,
Mario! You might be 
wearing green clothes...
But don't think I can't
tell you two apart.
Fine. If you're really 
Luigi, you'll be able to
spin in the air after a
backward somersault. 
You'll also have 
amazing agility and be 
able to run on water 
for a second. 


You'll also be able to 
scuttle in Standard Mode
by holding down [\r]FE05030002. 
When I see you do all 
that, maybe then I'll 
believe you're Luigi!</Text>
  <Text index="250" id="00FA">I can tell that you are
obsessed with money.
But since coins help you 
recover from injuries, we
should all be so greedy.

I hear red coins refill 2
pieces of the Power Meter
and blue coins refill 5.
That's incredible!</Text>
  <Text index="251" id="00FB">Wow! You've recovered 
that many Stars? Way to
go, Yoshi! I knew I could
count on you. You'll have
us out of here in no time!
Be careful, though.
Bowser and his band are 
getting desperate.
Here's a tip to help you 
out:
When you fall from a 
high place, you can avoid
getting hurt if you pound
the ground before you 
land.</Text>
  <Text index="252" id="00FC">Thanks! The castle is 
recovering its energy 
as you retrieve Power
Stars. 

You've chased Bowser 
right out of here, on 
to some area ahead.
Oh, by the way, are 
you collecting coins? 
Special Stars appear 
when you collect 100 
coins in each of the 
15 courses!</Text>
  <Text index="253" id="00FD">Hey, Luigi! I'm your 
biggest fan! You're the
best ”supporting actor”
the world's ever seen!
The work you've done 
guarding Mario is great!
I think if you were a 
bit more shrewd and 
assertive, you could 
definitely move into a
leading role!

By the way, are you
collecting coins? Special
Stars appear when you
collect 100 coins in 
each of the 15 courses!</Text>
  <Text index="254" id="00FE">Thank you, Wario!
The Power Stars are
returning one by one.
I feel terrible that I
misjudged you.

I assumed you came to
the castle to steal 
treasures...
It's just that you have
such a nasty-looking 
face, so I thought...
Oh, no, that's not 
what I meant to say! 
Your face is very tough
looking, very rugged. 
Perfect for scaring 
enemies. Ahem. 
Oh, yes. You like coins,
right? Special Stars 
appear when you collect
100 coins in each of 
the 15 courses!</Text>
  <Text index="255" id="00FF">Thank you, Yoshi!
The Power Stars are
returning one by one.
You've chased
Bowser right out of 
here!
Oh, by the way, are you

Stars appear when you

  <Text index="256" id="0100">Even if caps all look the
same, the one you've been
wearing for years is 
special. Without it, your
luck turns sour!
Hitting ? Blocks without
a cap can be downright
dangerous! Don't try it!


If you lose your cap, 
you'll find it in the 
course where you lost it.
Oh, and take this with 
you. I had it hidden.</Text>
  <Text index="257" id="0101">A piece of advice for the
hapless Luigi: Even if the
caps look the same, the
one you've been wearing 
for years is special.

It is said when you lose
your cap, your luck runs
out, too. When you're that
unlucky, you shouldn't hit
a ? Block... Who knows
what might happen?
If you lose your cap, 
you'll find it in the

Oh! Take this with you.
I had it hidden.</Text>

Even if all the caps look

Wario, although you have 
devilishly good luck, even
you'd be in trouble, too. 
See, without your cap, 
hitting a ? Block is
dangerous.
But don't worry. If you 
lose your cap, you'll find
it in the course where 
you lost it.
Oh! Take this with you.
I had it hidden.</Text>
  <Text index="259" id="0103">You don't normally wear
a cap, huh, Yoshi?
You should. I think one 
would look really 
good on you.

Plus, my advice is only 
for the fashion forward.
That said, let me give 
you this. 
I had it hidden for you.</Text>

If you lose your cap, 
you'll find it in the

just look at the map below.</Text>
  <Text index="262" id="0106">Wario, just because the

remember that the one 
you've been wearing for
years is lucky. Your luck

Don't count on your

to bail you out of this 
one, Wario. Without your

advice for the 
fashionably dressed.</Text>
  <Text index="264" id="0108">Thanks to the power of
the Stars, life is
returning to the castle.
Please, you have to 
give Bowser the boot!
Here, let me tell you a
little something about 
the castle:


In the room with the 
mirrors, look carefully
for anything that's not
reflected in the mirror.

You'll also find a friend
in that room who has 
seen the invisible man...
Which is weird because,
well, he's invisible.
And when you go to the
water town, you can 
flood it with a high 
jump into the painting.
Oh, and I found this.</Text>
  <Text index="265" id="0109">You're really whaling on
Bowser, Luigi!
We'll have to call you
the Luigi Brothers soon!
I'll tell you a secret
that will help you out.
In the room with the 
mirrors, look carefully
for anything that's not
reflected in the mirror.


And when you go to the
water town, you can 
flood it with a high 
jump into the painting.
Oh, I found this!</Text>
  <Text index="266" id="010A">Wario, I'm so touched.
You may be mean looking,
but you must have a good
heart if you've retrieved
this many Power Stars. 
You've proven yourself, 
which is why I trust you
with one of the castle's
secrets. 

In the room with the 
mirrors, look carefully 
for anything that's not 
reflected in the mirror.

And when you go to the

Oh, and I found this!</Text>
  <Text index="267" id="010B">Wow! Look at all those

Here!</Text>

You'd take that, right?</Text>
